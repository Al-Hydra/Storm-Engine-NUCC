# 010-Editor-Binary-Templates
Some [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor/) binary templates I made.

# Installation
Clone the repository and add each template to 010 Editor manually, as desired.

Instructions for adding a template (based on 010 Editor v10.0.2):
1. Go to `Templates` -> `View Installed Templates...` from the menu bar
2. Click on `Add` and select the .bt template file you'd like to add, and click on `OK` when you're done adding all templates

For the XFBIN template, adding only `xfbin.bt` is enough, as the other .bt files are referenced from that file.

# Usage

Usually, the opening a file in 010 Editor with the template installed will be enough, as it should run automatically.

If it doesn't, then pressing F5 to run the template (and selecting the right template when prompted to) will execute the template on the file.
